# Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space

![planet-kaggle](https://kaggle2.blob.core.windows.net/competitions/kaggle/6322/media/planet.png)

## About the competition

Predict classes(multi-class/labels) of the satellite images of Amazo forest.
to label satellite image chips with atmospheric conditions and various classes of land cover/land use. 

## Why? - the big picture

Every minute, the world loses an area of forest the size of 48 football fields. And deforestation in the Amazon Basin accounts for the largest share, contributing to reduced biodiversity, habitat loss, climate change, and other devastating effects. But better data about the location of deforestation and human encroachment on forests can help governments and local stakeholders respond more quickly and effectively.

Furthermore, these existing methods generally cannot differentiate between human causes of forest loss and natural causes. Higher resolution imagery has already been shown to be exceptionally good at this, but robust methods have not yet been developed for Planet imagery.

Resulting algorithms will help the global community better understand where, how, and why deforestation happens all over the world - and ultimately how to respond.
